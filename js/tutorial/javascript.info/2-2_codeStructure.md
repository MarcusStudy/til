# Code structure
- Semicolon separates statements
- Also, most of statements can be separated by new line, but we should not use new line to separate statements
- There are inline comment and multi-line comment
- No need to hesitate to write comment on the code because now-a-days comments can be removed by some software when we deploy the code
